avg.meanstd.ID -- name of table of results of tidy data for
HAR results, which average (mean) of results by activity 
and subject.id.

activities monitored in subjects. WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

subject.id -- integer value 1 to 30, denoting which of 30 subjects
was monitored for the measurement.

* As described in the avg.meanstd.ID desciption, all raw 
measurements described below were additionally averaged
by grouping factors of activity and subject.id. 

** All activity features are preceded by t or f, t denotes
a time domain measurement was sampled, processed, and recorded.
An f denotes that the measurement was further transformed 
into the frequency domain for further descriptive information.
